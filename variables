shell variables(act as local virables) and environment variables(act as global variables).
variables are compressed by NAME and VALUE.
with the shell, variables always store only one type of data, CHARACTER STRING.
  PARENT PROCESS(PARENT) and CHILD PROCESS(CHILD) for a instance, start vi(child) text edit on shell(parent).
At the time child is created, it INHERITS the PARENTD'S ENVIRONMENT.
export shell variable to make it environment variable.
